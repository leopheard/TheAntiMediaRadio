The Anti-Media Radio
=============================

<a href="www.kodi.tv">Kodi</a> audio addon for the <a href="http://www.theantimedia.com/radio">The Anti-Media Radio</a> podcast.<br>

<a href="http://www.theantimedia.com/radio">The Anti-Media Radio</a> came from a fiercely independent news blog to the Homepage of Independent Media is now complete. Our journey started when our founder Nick Bernabe launched a small anti-establishment Facebook page, and it grew into millions of social media followers and hundreds of millions of visits to our website. By combining our strengths of broad-spectrum anti-establishment journalism, strategic partnerships with dozens of premier independent media outlets, and a huge network of activists and free thinkers from across the political spectrum, we've created a new homepage for the independent media movement. Anti-Media is a non-partisan, anti-establishment news publisher and crowd-curated media aggregator.<br>
